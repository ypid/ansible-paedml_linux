### Warning, this is a Beta role

This role has been marked by the author as a beta role, which means that it

Manage paedML Linux using Ansible.

The ``ypid.paedml_linux`` role allows you to automate the deployment of a
[paedML Linux][] environment.

The role targets the two servers which are running [Univention Corporate Server][]
(which is based on Debian GNU/Linux).

To manage Opsi, there is a separate Ansible role which you are encouraged to
